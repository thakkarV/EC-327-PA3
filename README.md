# EC-327-PA3
the third programming assignment in a series of four for the intro to software engineering using  C++ class at Boston University. This programming assignment is a basic ASCII command line Warcraft simulator. PA4 builds on the code of PA3


This code was written by me in sections, defined by the checkpoints. Each checkpoint porgressively adds more and more classes to the code and the
main check cpp files are inteded to serve as test environments to debug the  behavior of these classes.

Each checkpoint main file has an assiociated makefile numbered with  the same checkpoint name.
